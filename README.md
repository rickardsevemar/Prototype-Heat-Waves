# Prototype Theme 4 - Heat Waves

The fourth prototype theme was set to be based on a song of choice. The criteria said:

- There has to be a system
- The player must be able to perform a SINGLE action
- The player should be able to express themselves through performing that action

The song that was chosen is called “Heat Waves - Glass Animals” and is a song that the group associated with driving along a barren highway, 
with your friends on a road trip. The game idea that sparked is a game where you are following a car through a relaxing environment, 
but instead of conventionally controlling the car, the player is instead controlling the day- and night cycle. 
During daytime the road radiates heat waves that heats the car up and makes it drive faster, and during the night the car cools down and drives slower. 
If the car is exposed to too much heat then it will explode and if the car cools down it will freeze. In both cases the game will end. 
The player must balance the heat waves to continue its journey of relaxation and meditation. 

The player will control the day- and night cycle with the scroll wheel. It will be the only action available to the player. 
As the player starts the game they will start to accumulate speed during the daytime and lose speed during night time. 
This will be synesthetically translated to the player by visually increased speed of the vehicle as well as a glowing effect on its hull - red for hot, 
blue for cold, while also through the auditory senses with the engine RPM (Revolutions per Minute). 
Once the player reaches an overheat the car will start smoking and eventually start burning, and by then the game is over. 
Similarly the same thing will happen but using frosty animations and a colder look to it if it freezes.

Developed in Unreal Engine 4 over two weeks.
